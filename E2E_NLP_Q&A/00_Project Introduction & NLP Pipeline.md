# Project Introduction & NLP Pipeline:

**1. What is the purpose of a project introduction in the context of
    natural language processing (NLP) projects?**

#### Explanation

- **Setting the Stage**:

> The project introduction is the first section of any project documentation.
> It outlines the problem, objectives, and significance of the work.
> Provides a clear understanding of why the project is important and what it intends to achieve.

 **Key Components**:

 - **Problem Statement**:

> Describes the issue or challenge the project is addressing. 
> Example:
> For a customer service chatbot, the problem might be inefficiency in
> handling customer inquiries.

 - **Objectives**:
>  - Defines the goals of the project.
>  - Example: 
>  Improving response times, reducing costs, increasing customer satisfaction.

 - **Significance**:

>  - Explains why the project is important and beneficial.
>  - Example: 
>  A chatbot providing 24/7 support to global customers.

 - **Scope**:

>  - Outlines what the project will and won’t cover.
>  - Example: 
>  Handling common queries but excluding complex problem-solving.

#### Real-Life Example: ShopEasy’s NLP Project

- **Problem Statement**:
> ShopEasy’s customer service team is overwhelmed by high inquiry volumes, leading to long wait times and customer dissatisfaction.

- **Objectives**:

> Develop a chatbot that:
> - Responds instantly to inquiries.
> - Handles common questions about orders, shipping, and returns.
> - Provides 24/7 support.

- **Significance**:

> - Benefits include:
> - Reduced customer wait times.
> - Improved customer satisfaction.
> - Lower operational costs.

- **Scope**:

> - The chatbot will manage frequently asked questions and basic order information.
> - It will not handle complex issues requiring human intervention.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages**:

- **Clarity and Direction**:

> - Provides clear direction for the team and stakeholders.
> - Example: 
> ShopEasy team focuses on common inquiries, not complex issues.

- **Stakeholder Buy-In**:

> - Helps gain support from stakeholders by clearly communicating benefits.
> - Example: 
> Management approves the project understanding the benefits.

**Disadvantages**:

- **Scope Creep**:

> - If not clear, the project may expand beyond initial objectives.
> - Example: 
> Team might try to implement features outside the chatbot’s scope.

- **Overly Ambitious Goals**:

> - Setting unrealistic goals can lead to disappointment or failure.
> - Example: 
> Aiming to solve all customer problems, including complex ones, might lead to project failure.

#### Use Cases

- **Customer Service Automation**:

> - Example: 
> ShopEasy uses NLP to automate customer service, reducing costs and improving response times.

- **Sentiment Analysis**:

> - Example: 
> A food delivery service uses NLP to analyze social media feedback to understand public sentiment.

- **Content Moderation**:

> - Example: 
> Facebook uses NLP to detect and filter inappropriate content automatically.
